<h2> Problem Definition </h2>
<p>
<!--
Give a concise description of current problem.  What
needs to be solved?  Why is the result useful?  Do you make any assumptions?
What are the anticipated difficulties?
-->
    There are three main parts to this assignment.
    In the first part of the assignment we are given frames of a person playing the piano.
    Our task is to segment the left and right hand from each frame.

    The second and third part of this assignment is to track objects in a video.
    In the second part, we are given the frames of a video of bats flying through the sky.
    We are also provided the segmention of those bats in the image by (x,y) coordinates in a
    CSV file. We need to use the kalman filter to track the bats through each frame.
    Finally, the third part we are given a frames of a video of cells moving in a petri dish.
    We have to provide a segmention of the cells and use the kalman filter to track each cell
    through the frames of the video.

    For each of these sections, we have to create a visual represention of our results.

<h2> Method and Implementation </h2>
<p>
<!--
  Give a concise description of the implemented method. For example, you might
  describe the motivation of your idea, the algorithmic steps of your methods, or
  the mathematical formulation of your method.

<!--
<p>
Describe your experiments, including the number of tests that you
performed, and the relevant parameter values.

</p>

<p>
Define your evaluation
metrics, e.g., detection rates, accuracy, running time. </p>
-->

<hr>

<h2> Results</h2>
<p>
<!--
List your experimental results.  Provide examples of input images and output
images. If relevant, you may provide images showing any intermediate steps.  If
your work involves videos, do not submit the videos but only links to them.
</p>
-->

</p>
<hr>
<h2> Discussion </h2>


<!--
Discuss your method and results:
<ul>
<li>What are the strengths and weaknesses of your method? </li>
<li>Do your results show that your method is generally successful or
     are there limitations? Describe what you expected to find in your
     experiments, and how that differed or was confirmed by your
     results. </li>
<li>Potential future work. How could your method be improved?   What
would you try (if you had more time) to overcome the
failures/limitations of your work?</li>
</ul>
-->

<hr>
<h2> Conclusion </h2>

<p>
<!--
Based on your discussion, what are your conclusions?  What is your
main message?-->

</p>

<hr>
<h2> Credits and Bibliography </h2>
<!--
<p>

Cite any papers or other references you consulted while developing
your solution.  Citations to papers should include the authors, the
year of publication, the title of the work, and the publication
information (e.g., book name and publisher; conference proceedings and
location; journal name, volume and pages; technical report and
institution).

<p>
Material on the web should include the url and date of access.
</p>

<p>
Credit any joint work or discussions with your classmates.
